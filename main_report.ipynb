    "This report compares User-Based and Item-Based collaborative filtering for the broad game geek dataset. Models were tuned using `GridSearchCV` and evaluated based on their RMSE. Due to computational constraints, the models were trained on the top 500 highest reviewed games and users with at least 44 reviews, reducing dataset from around 19 million to around 6.2 million ratings for training. The Item-based Neighborhood-based model achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 1.18, outperforming the user-based neighborhood methods, ALS, and SVD. However, neighbor-based models took up a long run time and increasing the dataset further crashes the memory. Therefore, ALS is deemed the next best method because it has the best RMSE for model-based methods while also having the ability to parallelize computations for larger datasets.\n",

    "Recommendation systems are a growing trend in the retail and e-commerce industry. For instance, there is an increasing need for online retail websites to grow consumer confidence in buying products. (Maruti Techlabs, 2021) In other words, in today’s digital age, these systems don’t only enhance consumer experiences but can also drive revenues for businesses. Therefore, mainstreaming this concept to other industries may allow users and consumers to increase their appreciation and engagement towards nicher product lines.

    "Recommender systems in the board game industry are a concept yet to be popularized. While it is common to hear about these systems in relation to the retail and film industry, it has yet to be mainstreamed for board games. Integrating this concept into this industry can represent a modern solution to a long-standing problem: helping players navigate an ever-expanding market filled with diverse titles, genres, and mechanics.  A recommender system fills this gap by analyzing player behavior and preferences to generate data-driven game suggestions. Rather than players falling victims to the “halo effect”, where players seek games from the same creators or publishers, users are exposed to lesser-known yet fitting titles.

    "A research by Zalewski, Ganzha, and Paprzycki (2019) explored the possibilities of this idea. There are three types of recommender systems: Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering, and a hybrid. (Maruti Techlabs, 2021) These authors clustered games according to shared characteristics then used collaborative filtering to recommend games to different users. The proposed algorithm achieved approximately 64% success in predicting preferred games. Therefore, demonstrating its potential to expand individual “game horizons.” In summary, recommender systems have the ability to enhance the social and cultural fabric of the board gaming industry by streamlining discovery and making it easier for every type of player to find games that truly resonate with their play style.\n",

    "This report's methodology comprises a five-step process. It begins with the collection of publicly available user review data sets from Jojie. The subsequent steps include exploratory data analysis, Preprocessing, Modeling, and Evaluation.

    "To begin, the data must first be examined and explored. Data Collection starts with initializing and inspecting the dataset from Jojie’s public library. This includes scanning through the data to identify error points and duplicates, and to identify how to clean the data for modeling. Then an exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify dataset dimensions, such as the no.of unique users and unique and board games, and analyze user ratings. This is shown through various plots and graphs to determine the distribution of ratings, user activity, game popularity, and reception. These initial steps lay the foundation in understanding the datasets structure and behavior to allow for more informed decisions for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\n",
    "The next step is the implementation of the model. First, the dataset undergoes data preprocessing. This includes filtering of relevant information. Then, the narrowed dataset undergoes two different types of collaborative filtering models: neighborhood-based and model-based. Under the neighborhood-based methods, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering were compared. On the other hand, for the model-based methods, alternating least squares and coordinate gradient descent were used. \n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\n",

    "Finally, to evaluate the best performing model, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be the basis of reliability and accuracy, serving as the key metric to evaluate how closely the model’s predicted ratings align with the actual user ratings.\n",

    "Before training the model, filters were applied to downsample the number of data points for computational feasibility while also ensuring data quality and relevance. First, the dataset was limited to only the top 500 most-reviewed games, allowing the study to focus on popular games with sufficient rating information. This reduced the dataset from 19 million to 9.5 million ratings. Second, the dataset was limited to users with more than 44 reviews within the top 500 games. Too few reviews may distort the model, like finding similar users, so setting that filter removes the noise in the data. It also allows the analysis to focus on users more engaged with the gaming community and have more reliable data. The final database accounts for 63,497 active users and 500 games. \n",

    "The figure above contains the distribution of board game reviews from the raw data. It can be observed that most reviews use whole digits while a small portion are more specific and use decimal places, indicating that while the majority of reviewers prefer the simplicity of an integer scale, a subset of reviewers want to provide more nuanced feedback. The distribution is left skewed, meaning that majority of reviews is concentrated on the higher end of the scale and very few reviews use the lower end of the range. The most common rating for a game is 7, accounting for 4 million of the reviews. This shows some sort of selection bias, meaning users are more likely to share positive experiences with the game, and users who dislike a game might simply stop playing and not bother submitting a review. This also shows the subjectivity of rating scales as the average experiences correspond to different ratings for different people. Therefore, mean-centering was used for the Neighborhood-based models to unify the scale across all users.\n",

This also showed that out of the two neighborhood-based models, item-based methods outperformed user-based for this use case. One possible reason for this is the fact that game characteristics rarely change while user preferences can change frequently over time. change slowly compared to user preferences. In addition, limiting the items to the top 500 compared to the over 63 thousand users made it faster to compute for similarity. However, one major downside of neighborhood based models is that it is computationally expensive as an increase in the number of datapoints require larger training times. Meanwhile, ALS, which had the second best RMSE of 1.1772, was able to perform relatively close to Item-based KNN while also being scalable due to its integration with Apache Spark. It was also able to gain a high accuracy with a small latent factor of only 4. Therefore, ALS was determined to be the best model.\n",

    "In conclusion, this analysis shows that there is no single “best” recommendation model that exists, as the most optimal choice depends on the deployment’s main goal. A clear trade-off emerged between accuracy, scalability, and speed. While the Item-Based Pearson KNN approach provided the highest accuracy with the lowest RMSE (1.1503), its utility in a production environment is limited. Therefore, the ALS model, with its competitive RMSE of 1.1772, is better as the all-around choice for a real-world system, due to it being built to scale efficiently with large datasets on Spark.\n",
